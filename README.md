# Car-Rental-Management-System
SQL Practice Sheet 18/11
Introduction

This project presents a complete SQL practice exercise built using SQLite.
It includes the design, creation, and querying of a small Car Rental Management System, covering essential database concepts from table creation to advanced SQL operations.

The database models three core entities:

Cars – information about each vehicle available for rent

Customers – individuals who rent vehicles

Rentals – records linking customers to cars, including dates and total cost

The project is organized into multiple parts that progressively develop SQL skills, including:

Creating tables and inserting data

Using filtering and logic with WHERE

Aggregating data using SUM, AVG, and COUNT

Joining tables with INNER, LEFT, and SELF JOIN

Applying SQL functions (UPPER, LENGTH, ROUND, date calculations)

Creating views and summary tables

Solving challenge tasks that combine several concepts

This repository showcases hands-on SQL development in SQLite and serves as a reference for learning relational database design and querying.
